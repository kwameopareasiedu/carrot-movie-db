# Carrot Movie DB

A simple movie recommender app built with the following:

1. `React`
2. `React Query`
3. `Vite`

## Setup

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/kwameopareasiedu/carrot-movie-db/)
2. Copy and past `/.env.sample` as `/.env` and provide the value of `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`
3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
5. Open the URL in the terminal to launch the app

> The app uses an API key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) which is tied to my account. This is provided
